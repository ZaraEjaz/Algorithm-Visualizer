## Algorithm Visualizer

The **Algorithm Visualizer** is an interactive web application that helps users understand and explore various algorithms and data structures through visual demonstrations. This tool provides a clear and intuitive visualization of how algorithms work, making it easier to grasp complex concepts. 

### Features
- **Path Finding Algorithms**: Visualize how different pathfinding algorithms, like A*, Dijkstra, and others, determine the most efficient route between two points.
- **Binary Search**: Watch how binary search efficiently finds the position of a target value in a sorted collection.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Explore various sorting techniques, such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort, and see how they arrange data in ascending or descending order.
- **Linear Search**: Understand how linear search operates by sequentially checking each element in a list until the target value is found.
- **Stack and Queue**: Learn the workings of fundamental data structures like Stack (LIFO) and Queue (FIFO) through engaging visual representations.
- **Linked List**: Visualize the structure and traversal of linked lists, where elements are connected via pointers in a linear sequence.

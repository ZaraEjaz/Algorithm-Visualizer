## Algorithm Visualizer

The **Algorithm Visualizer** is an interactive web application that helps users understand and explore various algorithms and data structures through visual demonstrations. This tool provides a clear and intuitive visualization of how algorithms work, making it easier to grasp complex concepts. 

### Features
- **Path Finding Algorithms**: Visualize how different pathfinding algorithms, like A*, Dijkstra, and others, determine the most efficient route between two points.
